## Description

This project was coded by Nicolas Towery as part of [Jonas Schmedtmann's React Course.](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) The project utilizes React Router, React Router Forms, and Redux for complex UI state management.

Fast React Pizza is a faux-store where users can create, view, and update orders for pizza deliveries! It dynamically fetches menu items from an API. The menu items will be conditionally rendered depending on their stock level. The application allows for customers to use geo-location for obtaining the address for delivery. Users can also search up orders by order ID to see order status, time remaining, and to also make updates to the order.
